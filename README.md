# GameEngineRM

A clean Remake (hopefully) of my GameEngine originally inspired by ThinMatrix but also guidance taken from Cherno, ChiliTomatoNoodle, Hopsen BentlyBox just to name a few Youtubers who I watched to help me make it this far. I have also spent many many hours reading books, documentations and other forms of tutorials. Least of all, countless hours of trail and error (mostly error).

When complete this will be a library/SDK/API of sorts giving unified access to Graphics, Sound, Mouse/Keyboard input, basic physics, and several more features. This is a personal project, any help is appreciated but please don't take offence if I reject help.
